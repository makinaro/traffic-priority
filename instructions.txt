—-------------------------------
Activity One
The data will contain the priority, the traffic movement (sign, primary lane and secondary lanes, direction), and the time. This will be stored in the file called “traffic.dat”.

Find the total time before a main pedestrian will be able to cross the road.

Activity Two
The data is similar to activity one but will be stored in a file separated with a comma and will contain multiple scenarios.

The result will be stored back into a file called “traffic_result.dat”.
